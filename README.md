# statekit

Statekit is a minimal state management library for Go providing proctored access to state items and observability.

I'm currently developing it as part of a game I'm working on and will provide more complete documentation as it proves itself in practice. For now, check the example in `examples/`.

## Installation
```sh
go get github.com/konapun/statekit
```
